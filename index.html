      <img src="assets/images/basic profile pic.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Michael Tran">

      <p>Now this is a story all about how
      My life got flipped-turned upside down
      And I'd like to take a minute
      Just sit right there
      I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air
      </p>

      <p>In west Philadelphia born and raised
      On the playground was where I spent most of my days
      Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
      And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
      When a couple of guys who were up to no good
      Started making trouble in my neighborhood
      I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
      She said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air.
      </p>
